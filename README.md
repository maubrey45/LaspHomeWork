# Lasp Homework Assignment
This is a homework assignment that was given to me by Lasp by Fernando Sanchez 
The goal of the project I completed was taking a csv file and printing out the json list. 
Given that what I have done have taken in the csv file and dumped the data so it was in a json file. After that i read in the json file and printed it out onto the screen. <br> <br>
All one has to download is the main.py and then run the program to be able to get the output. It shoud print out a text output in which when read by the jsonlint program does return correct. <br>
However if one does download the full repository it should not matter and will run fine. <br>
Steps to run code: <br>
once in the folder in the command line run "python main.py | jsonlint"
