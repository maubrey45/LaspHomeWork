# LaspHomeWork
This is a homework assignment that was given to me by Lasp by Fernando Sanchez 
The goal of the project I completed was taking a csv file and printing out the json list. 
Given that what I have done have taken in the csv file and dumped the data so it was in a json file. After that i read in the json file and printed it out onto the screen.
